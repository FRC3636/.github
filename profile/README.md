Generals Robotics, team # 3636 in the [FIRST Robotics Competition][frc], was founded in 2011 as a way to promote STEM at Grant High School.

All are welcome on Generals Robotics; experience in S.T.E.M. is not a prerequisite for membership. Members acquire valuable life skills and professional connections during their time on the team. Participation in FIRST programs such as FRC opens a myriad of new pathways for students, from securing internships and grants to building a network of experienced mentors in the engineering industry.
